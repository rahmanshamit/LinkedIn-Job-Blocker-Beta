## 🛠️ Why This Extension?
LinkedIn users often encounter repetitive or irrelevant job postings from specific companies. LinkedIn Job Blocker solves this by giving you the power to hide posts from those companies and tailor your job feed to your preferences, 
so that you see jobs and listings you want to see, removing unwanted posts from taking up screen real estate. 

## 🧩 How It Works
- Click on a job posting to view the details.
- Use the Block button beside the company name to hide all job postings from that company.
- Enjoy a cleaner, more focused job search experience!

##📋 Next Steps
Thorough Testing: Validate the extension's functionality across various LinkedIn pages and job search scenarios.

Issue submission is open to continue maintenance and improvement of this tool. 
LinkedIn aggressively refreshes and updates their frontend and DOM, so regular updates and
maintenance is necessary.
